## MATT CHAN'S SUBMISSION FOR FS1010

## INSTRUCTIONS

1) Apologies for the inconvenience, my API file is not cooperating, as such I've included it as a ZIP file, please extract it to replace the empty API folder that comes with the cloned version
2) Start by opening the main folder and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies
3) Start the application by running `npm start` command from the folder where the `App.js` component is found
4) The React site should be running on localhost:3000, with the API running on localhost:4000 simultaneously.

## THINGS TO NOTE
Please note that the `npm start` command will open a second localhost on 4000 to run the API for form submission. This will update the form list in real time and you can see the information that was submitted when you log into the admin portion of the site.
